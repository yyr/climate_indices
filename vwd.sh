# ECAR95P - Very wet days w.r.t. 95th percentile of reference period
# eca_r95p infile1 infile2 outfile

# Description
# Let infile1 be a time series RR of the daily precipitation amount at wet
# days (precipitation >= 1 mm) and infile2 be the 95th percentile RRn95 of the
# daily precipitation amount at wet days for any period used as
# reference. Then the percentage of wet days with RR > RRn95 is
# calculated. RRn95 is calculated as the 95th percentile of all wet days of a
# given climate reference period. Usually infile2 is generated by the operator
# ydaypctl,95. The date information of a timestep in outfile is the date of
# the last contributing timestep in infile1. The following variables are
# created:
# â€¢ very wet days wrt 95th percentile of reference period
