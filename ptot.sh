# ECAR95PTOT - Precipitation percent due to R95p days
# eca_r95ptot infile1 infile2 outfile

# Description
# Let infile1 be a time series RR of the daily precipitation amount at wet
# days (precipitation >= 1 mm) and infile2 be the 95th percentile RRn95 of the
# daily precipitation amount at wet days for any period used as
# reference. Then the ratio of the precipitation sum at wet days with RR >
# RRn95 to the total precipitation sum is calculated. RRn95 is calculated as
# the 95th percentile of all wet days of a given climate reference
# period. Usually infile2 is generated by the operator ydaypctl,95. The date
# information of a timestep in outfile is the date of the last contributing
# timestep in infile1.  The following variables are created:
# â€¢ precipitation percent due to R95p days
